# Linear Regression
This Program applies the linear-regression algorithm to a dataset

### What is Linear Regression?

 Linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between two variables and the aim
 of linear regressio is to find line of best fit between the data points.
 
 ### How it works
 
 This program interprets data from a data set from which it derives a gradient and intercept
 for the line of best fit which is a linear equation with the expression mx + c, where m and c
 are the gradient and intercept respectively.
 
 Once, the data is processed and the gradient and intercept are obtain,
 the program plots the data on a scatterplot including the line of best fit.
